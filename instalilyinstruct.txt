Congratulations, you are a candidate for joining the Instalily team! For your submission, we ask that you submit a copy of your source code and a Loom video walkthrough. You’re welcome to be creative—feel free to include a slide deck or any other visual aids to explain your design choices and implementation.


Background
This case study aims to design and develop a chat agent for the PartSelect e-commerce website. Given the extensive product catalog, the focus will be on Refrigerator and Dishwasher parts. The agent's primary function is to provide product information and assist with customer transactions. It is crucial that the chat agent remains focused on this specific use case, avoiding responses to questions outside this scope. Focus on the user experience and the extensibility of your implementation.


Frontend
Use a modern framework (e.g., React) for the chat interface, ensuring it aligns with PartSelect’s branding. You will also select the features that you want available on the chat agent (think broadly – what do users want to use the chat for, how should users see products in the chat, order support, etc.).

Backend
Choose any backend architecture that you would like. You are free to use any online tools, vector databases, and supplementary materials in your approach. The implementation must include integration with the Deepseek language model.


Success Criteria
Your case study will be evaluated based on but not limited to the design of your interface, agentic architecture, extensibility and scalability of your approach, and ability to answer user queries accurately and efficiently. Below is a list of example inquiries. These should serve as a foundation to guide your approach, while keeping in mind that your solution should not be confined solely to these examples.
